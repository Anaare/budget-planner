This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

- Need to create NOT FOUND page.
- Transaction Management: Users can manually add income and expense transactions. Each transaction includes:
  Amount, Date, Description
  Category (e.g., "Groceries," "Rent," "Salary," "Freelance Income")
  Type (Income/Expense)
  Next.js API Routes: CRUD operations for transactions.
  MongoDB: Store transaction data linked to users.
  React Components: Forms for adding transactions, tables for displaying them.
  Tailwind CSS: Style the transaction input and display.
