## Getting Started

- Need to create NOT FOUND page.
- Transaction Management: Users can manually add income and expense transactions. Each transaction includes:
  Amount, Date, Description
  Category (e.g., "Groceries," "Rent," "Salary," "Freelance Income")
  Type (Income/Expense)
  Next.js API Routes: CRUD operations for transactions.
  MongoDB: Store transaction data linked to users.
  React Components: Forms for adding transactions, tables for displaying them.
  Tailwind CSS: Style the transaction input and display.

1. I need to add remove btn for transaction - OK
2. Edit btn too: It'll open form with existing data and user will modify it however needed +
3. formatting for date in table - OK
4. I need to add toasts in form too for better UX
