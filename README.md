## Getting Started

### User

1. Now users get ALL the data. I need to create user IDs and fetch data accordingly
2. I'm pretty sure I should get rid of user icon since user won't be able to make any modifications

### Dashboard

### Settings

### Sign in options

1. I could add github just to practice
2. Maybe later form of registration too which will also need users scheme in Mongo
