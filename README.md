## Getting Started

### Budgeting

1. Budget Setup
   Users need a way to define their budget for a specific period (e.g., monthly).

Budget Period Selection: Allow users to select the month or custom date range for which they want to create a budget. - DONE

Category-Based Budgeting: This is crucial. Users should be able to set a target potential income and allocate a maximum potential expense for each existing category (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment, Bills). You might also allow them to add custom budget categories.

Overall Income/Expense Targets: Beyond categories, they might set a total expected income and total planned expenses for the period.

2. Budget vs. Actual Comparison
   This is where the magic happens and provides the actionable insights.

Real-time Tracking: As users add actual transactions, the budget feature should update dynamically, showing how much of their budget they've spent (or earned) for each category.

Visual Representation: Use progress bars, charts (like a bar chart comparing budgeted vs. actual for each category), or color-coding (e.g., green for under budget, red for over budget) to make the comparison immediately understandable.

Summary View: A dashboard or summary showing overall budget performance (e.g., "You have $X remaining in your budget this month" or "You are $Y over budget").

Drill-down Capability: Allow users to click on a category to see the individual transactions that contribute to its actual spending.

3. Reporting and Insights
   Beyond the current month, provide historical budget performance.

Monthly Budget Reports: Let users review past budgets and their actual performance.

Trends Over Time: Show how spending in certain categories or overall budget adherence has changed over several months. This could highlight problematic spending patterns.

Alerts and Notifications: Optionally, notify users when they're close to exceeding a budget category or when they've surpassed it.
